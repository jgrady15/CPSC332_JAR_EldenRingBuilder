# Main Objective
The goal of this project is to demonstrate profiencency in PHP and SQL in a group environment. We will be using Javascript to render client-side information, AJAX to handle asynchronous server-side rendering, and PHP to push/pull data which will be stored in a SQL format.

The Big Picture.
1) Use Javascript to render client-side
2) AJAX to call PHP code (server-side rendering), which will call SQL functions to push/pull data 
3) PHP Code pulls data and pushes back code to us, which we will display to client-side
